1: keep magic numbers OUT OF YOUR CODE

2: describe the overall flow of the logic for the entire application and specifically the part
   where the protocol is implemented. 
   
3: Write tests. And write crazy tests where you are flooding the code with unexpected crap. Happy
case testing is bad and worse than no testing.
